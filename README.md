# SentinelTrail

SentinelTrail is a security-focused audit logging platform designed to provide tamper-evident, verifiable audit trails for distributed systems.

## Why SentinelTrail Exists
Modern logs are easy to store and easy to tamper with. SentinelTrail treats logs as evidence, not debug output.

## High-Level Architecture
(Architecture diagram to be added)

## Core Guarantees
